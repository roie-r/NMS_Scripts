GLOBALS, META, MODELS, SHIPS, TABLES & UI folders are my regular-use modifications. They all can be used together and doesn't confict - they might be considered a single comprehensive mod.<br>
Most of the scripts are my own, others were collected from -or inspired by others.<br>
The scripts contain a short description of what they do, even if the name is not always descriptive :)<br>
